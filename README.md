### The Music that Moved Howl's Castle
- Project Duration: Nov-Dec 2021
- For: Project 3 (Data visualization), part of *KAIST ID221* Information Design by Prof. Hwajeong Hong

This code is vanilla javascript based on p5js. The hand-collected data annotates all 22 instances of the recurring musical leitmotiv known as "The Merry Go-Round of Life" in Studio Ghibli film "Howl's Moving Castle". The source code uses each field of this data to render 'falling stars' similar to a scene in the movie.
The full project and worklog is available [here](https://livelybeta.notion.site/Seokhun-Jeong-b0a1df95d93c442eaf3443fa88ebbd8f?p=506783785c544fa4b8b066001d1d59d9&pm=c)

To run the code, simply clone or download the repository and open `index.html`.
